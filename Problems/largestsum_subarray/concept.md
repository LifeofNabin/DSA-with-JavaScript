const nums = input
    .split(",")
    .map((num) => parseInt(num.trim(), 10))
    .filter((num) => !isNaN(num));
input.split(","):

This part takes the string input, which is expected to be a comma-separated list of values (e.g., "1, -2, 3").
The split(",") method divides the string into an array of substrings using the comma as a delimiter.
For example, the string "1, -2, 3" becomes ["1", " -2", " 3"].
.map((num) => parseInt(num.trim(), 10)):

The map function creates a new array by applying the provided function to each element of the original array.
For each num in the array, it calls num.trim(), which removes any leading or trailing whitespace.
Then, parseInt(..., 10) converts the trimmed string to an integer. The 10 specifies that the number should be parsed as a base-10 integer.
For example, ["1", " -2", " 3"] would become [1, -2, 3].
.filter((num) => !isNaN(num)):

The filter function creates a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
!isNaN(num) checks if num is not NaN (Not-a-Number). This ensures that only valid numbers remain in the array.
If a non-numeric value was passed (e.g., if the user entered "1, a, 3"), that would result in NaN for "a", which would be filtered out.
The final output would include only the valid numbers.
Summary
This line of code takes a user input string, splits it into individual components, trims any extra spaces, converts valid components to integers, and filters out any invalid values, resulting in an array of numbers that can be used in further calculations.
