The problem involves an array where each element represents the maximum jump length you can take from that position. The goal is to find the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last index of the array from the first index.

Explanation
Understanding the Array:

Each index in the array tells you how far you can jump forward. For example, if the array is [2, 3, 1, 1, 4], starting at index 0 (value 2), you can jump to index 1 or 2.
Greedy Approach:

 The greedy approach focuses on making local optimal choices (jumping to the farthest position possible) at each step, which leads to a globally optimal solution. 
Instead of trying all possible paths (which could be inefficient), this method calculates how far you can get with the jumps you have made so far.
Tracking Jumps:

You keep track of:
jumps: The number of jumps made so far.
currentEnd: The farthest index you can reach with the current number of jumps.
farthest: The farthest index you can reach with the next jump.
Iterating through the Array:

For each index, calculate how far you can go (farthest = Math.max(farthest, i + arr[i])).
When you reach currentEnd, increment the jump count and update currentEnd to farthest.
If currentEnd reaches or exceeds the last index, you can stop early.
Example Walkthrough
Consider the array [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]:

Start at index 0: You can jump to indices 1 or 2.
From index 1 (which you can reach from 0), you can jump to 4 (farthest), so you take a jump.
Now at index 1, youâ€™ve made your first jump. Update your currentEnd to 4, which is the farthest you can reach from 1.
Since you've reached the end in 2 jumps (from 0 to 1 and then from 1 to 4), the minimum jumps required is 2.
Summary
The greedy approach efficiently computes the minimum jumps by always aiming to extend your reach to the maximum possible distance at each step. The key is updating the jump count only when you reach the limit of your current jump capacity. This leads to a time-efficient O(n) solution with constant space usage O(1).
