Concept Breakdown
Understanding Maximum Difference:

The maximum difference between heights is calculated as the difference between the tallest and shortest heights.
If you have heights 
ℎ
1
,
ℎ
2
,
…
,
ℎ
𝑛
h 
1
​
 ,h 
2
​
 ,…,h 
n
​
 , the maximum difference is 
max
(
ℎ
)
−
min
(
ℎ
)
max(h)−min(h).
Adjusting Heights:

You can either increase the shortest height or decrease the tallest height (or both) to minimize this difference.
If you can change each height by a maximum value 
𝑘
k, you can:
Increase the smallest height by 
𝑘
k.
Decrease the largest height by 
𝑘
k.
Optimal Approach:

Sort the heights to easily identify the maximum and minimum values.
After sorting, adjust the maximum and minimum heights by 
𝑘
k:
New maximum height after adjustment: 
max
(
ℎ
)
−
𝑘
max(h)−k
New minimum height after adjustment: 
min
(
ℎ
)
+
𝑘
min(h)+k
Calculation of New Maximum Difference:

After adjustments, the new maximum difference can be computed:
New Difference
=
(
max
(
ℎ
)
−
𝑘
)
−
(
min
(
ℎ
)
+
𝑘
)
=
max
(
ℎ
)
−
min
(
ℎ
)
−
2
𝑘
New Difference=(max(h)−k)−(min(h)+k)=max(h)−min(h)−2k
This means the maximum difference decreases by 
2
𝑘
2k if the original difference is greater than 
2
𝑘
2k.
Constraints:

If 
max
(
ℎ
)
−
min
(
ℎ
)
≤
2
𝑘
max(h)−min(h)≤2k, you can make all heights the same or very close, resulting in a maximum difference of 0 or near-zero.
Iterative Approach (if needed):

If there are constraints or more complex scenarios, you might explore iterative adjustments or even binary search to find the optimal configuration.
Visual Representation
You can visualize this process with a simple example:

Given heights: [3, 7, 8, 10] and 
𝑘
=
2
k=2
Sorted heights: [3, 7, 8, 10]
New maximum: 
10
−
2
=
8
10−2=8
New minimum: 
3
+
2
=
5
3+2=5
New difference: 
8
−
5
=
3
8−5=3
