# Concept Breakdown

## Understanding Maximum Difference

- The maximum difference between heights is calculated as the difference between the tallest and shortest heights.
- For heights \( h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_n \), the maximum difference is:
  \[
  \text{max}(h) - \text{min}(h)
  \]

## Adjusting Heights

- You can either increase the shortest height or decrease the tallest height (or both) to minimize this difference.
- If you can change each height by a maximum value \( k \), you can:
  - Increase the smallest height by \( k \).
  - Decrease the largest height by \( k \).

## Optimal Approach

1. **Sort the Heights:** 
   - This helps easily identify the maximum and minimum values.

2. **Adjust the Maximum and Minimum Heights by \( k \):**
   - New maximum height after adjustment:
     \[
     \text{max}(h) - k
     \]
   - New minimum height after adjustment:
     \[
     \text{min}(h) + k
     \]

## Calculation of New Maximum Difference

- After adjustments, the new maximum difference can be computed:
  \[
  \text{New Difference} = (\text{max}(h) - k) - (\text{min}(h) + k) = \text{max}(h) - \text{min}(h) - 2k
  \]
- This means the maximum difference decreases by \( 2k \) if the original difference is greater than \( 2k \).

## Constraints

- If:
  \[
  \text{max}(h) - \text{min}(h) \leq 2k
  \]
  you can make all heights the same or very close, resulting in a maximum difference of 0 or near-zero.

## Iterative Approach (if needed)

- For more complex scenarios, consider iterative adjustments or even binary search to find the optimal configuration.

## Visual Representation

### Example

- Given heights: **[3, 7, 8, 10]** and \( k = 2 \)
- Sorted heights: **[3, 7, 8, 10]**

- **New maximum:**
  \[
  10 - 2 = 8
  \]

- **New minimum:**
  \[
  3 + 2 = 5
  \]

- **New difference:**
  \[
  8 - 5 = 3
  \]
