1. Array Manipulation
Accessing Elements: The program accesses elements of the array using their indices.
Modifying Elements: It modifies the elements of the array to achieve the desired rotation.
2. Looping Constructs
For Loop: A for loop is used to iterate through the array from the last element to the first, allowing for the shifting of elements.
3. Temporary Storage
Variable for Last Element: The last element of the array is stored in a temporary variable before starting the rotation. This prevents loss of data when shifting elements.
4. Edge Case Handling
Empty Array Check: The function checks if the array is empty at the beginning. This prevents errors during execution and ensures the function behaves correctly for all input cases.
5. Cyclic Rotation Logic
The logic behind the rotation involves shifting all elements one position to the right and placing the last element at the start of the array, creating a "cyclic" effect.
